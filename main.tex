\section{Introduction}
Stackoverflow is one of the most popular question and answer sites where people ask and answer technical questions about software development and maintenance. 

In most of the time, for natural language same question can be explained in different ways. Because of this, we might not have the common words repeating between two questions, but conceptually they are sharing the same knowledge. With existing traditional methods( like LDA) this can not be identified due to lack of common words. (REF --> XIN XIA "Predicting Semantically Linkable Knowledge in Developer Online Forums via Convolutional Neural Network")

\section{Plan for papers}
1. In duplicate question detection
2. In similar question identification (user will query for a concept and we have to find the questions mapping for it)

\section{IDEAS}
Draft of ideas;

1. What is the research problem?
There are no proper way to find the similar context if it is not textually equal. 
2. Joining semantically similar questions
3. Linking knowledge
